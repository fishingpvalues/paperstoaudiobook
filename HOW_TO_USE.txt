                    PDF TO AUDIOBOOK CONVERTER
                     Simple Guide for Everyone
===============================================================================

WHAT DOES THIS DO?
------------------
This program turns your PDF documents into audiobooks (MP3 files) that you
can listen to on your phone, computer, or any audio player. Perfect for:
- Study materials you want to listen to while driving
- Long articles or papers
- Any PDF you'd rather listen to than read


HOW TO USE IT (SUPER SIMPLE!)
------------------------------

STEP 1: Put your PDFs in the "input" folder
   - Look for a folder called "input" (it's in the same place as this file)
   - Copy or drag your PDF files into that folder
   - You can add as many PDFs as you want!

STEP 2: Run the converter
   - Double-click the file called "pdf_to_audiobook.py"
   - OR open a terminal/command prompt and type: python pdf_to_audiobook.py
   - The program will show you progress bars so you know it's working!

STEP 3: Get your audiobooks!
   - When it's done, look in the "output" folder
   - Your audiobooks will be there as MP3 files
   - They have the same name as your PDFs but end in .mp3


WHAT YOU'LL SEE WHILE IT WORKS
-------------------------------
The program shows friendly progress bars like this:
   Reading pages: 75%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ     | 15/20 pages
   Creating audio: 50%|â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ           | 50/100 segments

First time? It might download some files (voice data) - this only happens once!


HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
-----------------------
- Reading the PDF: Usually very fast (seconds)
- Creating audio: About 2-3 minutes per 1000 words
- Longer documents = more time (grab a coffee!)


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: "No PDF files found!"
A: Make sure your PDFs are in the "input" folder, not in any subfolders.

Q: It's taking forever!
A: This is normal! Audio generation takes time. You'll see a progress bar.
   A 20-page document might take 5-10 minutes.

Q: The audio is cut off or weird
A: Your PDF might have images or special formatting. The program works best
   with PDFs that have regular text (like books or articles).

Q: I got an error message
A: Try these:
   1. Make sure the PDF isn't password-protected
   2. Check that the PDF has actual text (not just scanned images)
   3. Try a different PDF to see if it works


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
----------------------
âœ“ Works best with text-based PDFs (books, articles, papers)
âœ“ Make sure PDFs aren't password-protected
âœ“ Longer PDFs take longer - be patient!
âœ“ The audio quality is very natural and pleasant to listen to


TECHNICAL DETAILS (for the curious)
------------------------------------
- Uses Kokoro TTS for natural-sounding speech
- Female voice (af_bella) - clear and easy to understand
- 128kbps MP3 quality - great sound, reasonable file size
- Works entirely on your computer - no internet needed (after initial setup)
- CPU-only processing - no fancy graphics card required


NEED HELP?
----------
If you're stuck or something doesn't work, check the error messages.
They usually tell you what went wrong in plain English!
